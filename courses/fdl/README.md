# Fundamentals of Deep Learning Course Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and environment setup files for a hands-on deep learning course. The notebooks introduce  image classification, convolutional neural networks, data augmentation, model deployment, transfer learning, and natural language processing.

### `Dockerfile`

Builds a JupyterLab environment based on `pytorch/pytorch:2.1.0-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime`. It installs the Python packages needed by the notebooks, copies the contents of `tutorials/` into `/dli/task`, exposes port `8888`, and starts JupyterLab.

The Docker image is intended for hosts with an NVIDIA GPU and `nvidia-container-toolkit` installed.

### `environment/`

Contains environment setup files:

- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for running the notebooks with `pip`.
- `entrypoint.sh`: JupyterLab startup script for environments that use a shell entrypoint.

### `tutorials/`

Contains the course notebooks:

- `00_jupyterlab.ipynb`: JupyterLab introduction and basic workflow.
- `01_mnist.ipynb`: Image classification with the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- `02_asl.ipynb`: Image classification with an American Sign Language dataset.
- `03_asl_cnn.ipynb`: Convolutional neural networks for image classification.
- `04a_asl_augmentation.ipynb`: Data augmentation to improve model generalization.
- `04b_asl_predictions.ipynb`: Using a trained model to make predictions.
- `05a_doggy_door.ipynb`: Using pre-trained models.
- `05b_presidential_doggy_door.ipynb`: Transfer learning with a pre-trained model.
- `06_nlp.ipynb`: Natural language processing with sequence data.
- `utils.py`: Shared helper code used by the notebooks.

## Run with Docker

From this directory, build the image:

```bash
docker build -t fdl-course .
```

Run JupyterLab:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 8888:8888 fdl-course
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8888/lab
```

To keep notebook edits on your local machine, mount the `tutorials/` directory when running the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "$PWD/tutorials:/dli/task" \
  fdl-course
```

If port `8888` is already in use, map a different local port:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -p 8890:8888 fdl-course
```

Then open `http://localhost:8890/lab`.

## Run Locally with `pip`

If you do not want to use Docker, create a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies from `environment/requirements.txt`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
```

Start JupyterLab from the repository directory:

```bash
jupyter lab tutorials
```

or simply by running the script on `environment/entrypoint.sh`

```bash
sh environment/entrypoint.sh
```

JupyterLab will print a local URL in the terminal. Open that URL in your browser, then select a notebook from the file browser.

## Notes

- Some notebooks may download datasets or pre-trained model files the first time they run.
- The Docker setup uses a CUDA-enabled PyTorch image. On machines without an NVIDIA GPU, the local `pip` setup is usually the simpler option.
- Stop JupyterLab with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running.
