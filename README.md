Fundamentals of Deep Learning is an open-source, hands-on course from the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) that introduces neural networks, convolutional architectures, and transfer learning through interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## Learning Outcomes

In these labs, learners will:

- Build and train neural networks using PyTorch on real image datasets
- Apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to image classification tasks
- Use data augmentation and transfer learning to improve accuracy on limited data
- Manage the bias-variance tradeoff and apply techniques to address overfitting
- Deploy a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data

## Usage

### Getting Started

#### 1. Launch with Brev (Recommended)

🌟 [Launch this course on NVIDIA Brev](https://brev.nvidia.com/)

1. Click the **Launch on Brev** button above (or the badge at the top of this README).
2. Sign in or create a free NVIDIA Brev account.
3. Select a GPU instance — an NVIDIA T4 or L4 is sufficient for all five labs.
4. Click **Deploy**. The environment will be ready in ~2 minutes with CUDA,
   Python, and all dependencies pre-installed.
5. Open JupyterLab from the Brev console and navigate to the `course_content/tutorials/` directory.

#### 2. Clone and run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVDLI/fundamentals-of-deep-learning.git
cd course_content
```

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+, an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 11.8+ (CPU-only works
but is slow for later notebooks), and conda or pip.

```bash
pip install -r environment/requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

Then open <http://localhost:8888> in your browser and navigate to the
`tutorials/` directory.

#### 3. Run with Docker

To deploy the content with the provided `Dockerfile`, run:

```bash
docker build -t fdl-app . && docker run -d -p 8888:8888 --name fdl-container --gpus all fdl-app
```

Then open <http://localhost:8888> in your browser and navigate to the
`tutorials/` directory.
